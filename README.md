# Excalitaur

> [!NOTE]  
> Prebuilt binaries for all platforms can be found under the [Releases](https://github.com/mass1ve-err0r/excalitaur/releases) page!


## Purpose
This project basically bundles [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) with [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)
to provide a more native feel to Excalidraw.


### Note
It's saving options have been thinned down to plain saving to disk & loading from disk, I personally don't need more.

The only feature missing is the image generation from the canvas. I'll implement it back when I have more time.


### Feature Overview

- [x] Saving to disk
- [x] Loading to disk
- [ ] Save as Image


## Build Instructions
You can either launch it directly with `devbuild` or build your own copy with `prodbuild`.
