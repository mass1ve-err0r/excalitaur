# Excalitaur

> [!NOTE]  
> Prebuilt binaries for all platforms can be found under the [Releases](https://github.com/mass1ve-err0r/excalitaur/releases) page!


## Purpose
This project basically bundles [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) with [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)
to provide a more native feel to Excalidraw.


### Technicalities
It's a basic tauri-react app with excalidraw included as dependency, therefore no modification are done to the core.

Updating becomes as easy as using the new dependency and rebuilding the project, that's it.
You can also just download the newest binaries from this repository.
